      <h2>Rings Specialist</h2>
      <p>If I had to share my most favorable part of high school it would defintely be the day I joined the varsity gymnastics team.</p>
      <p>I sacrificed a summer internship and a family vaction to Canada  just so I could become mentally and physically fit to join the team. A team of goal-oriented teens who all wanted one thing, be champions. I studied film at home and in my ocach's office of modern and past gymnast. I was in such awe of all the awesome skills performed on the rings aperatus that I made it mission to aquire as many skills as I could.</p>
      <p> My <b>Knights brothers</b> and I made school history. We broke a <b>40 year curse.</b> Yes, for 40 years the school has never won City or State Chmapionsip and we clinched tha t chip that not once but <b>TWICE</b></p>

      <h1>Alianza Compass</h1>
      <p>The summer that I moved back home from Utah after majoring in Computer Science at Neumont University I seeked out a job that would allow me to start paying off my student loans. </p>
      <p>Though I loved my collge, my schorlarship wasn't enough to pay for my tuiton and my flat.</p>
       <p>Thankfully, Angel, the Program Director said he would hire me after reinterviewing me. Little did I know that my job as a after-school tutor would become more valueable over time. Through my years working there I learned the importance of time mangemnet, positivity, leadership, teamwork, creating alternative solutions when space is limited and to how to make any dull moment fun. As you'll see below I was later in charge of running a lot of awesome activites.</p>

      <h1>Borough of Manhattan Community College</h1>
      <p>As a student here I major in Computer Information Systems.
      Where I have learned Java object-oriented programming with Prof. Persuad. Who helped me conceptualize how good computer code should be constructed. 
      <p>My completion of his rigorous class has enabled me to  bravely venture off on my own learning other languages outside of school like Python for data science by spending late nights at Barnes & Nobel reading, "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthews, attending classes at The Knowledge House (bootcamp for developers) and Node.js for creating Amazon Alexa skills via AWS Loft in New York City. </p>
      I'm familiar with operating system architecture through my Unix class, various computer form factors throgh my Hardware class and the exchange of information through LAN, WAN, and MAN networks along with TCP/IP topologies that a  network administrator can implement at his or her company or business from my Telecommunications class.</p>

      <h2>Two consecutive years coaching chess</h2>
      <p> Admittedly, I'm not the best chess player but I'm full of positivity and motivation. I'm always encourage my students to have fun,think strategically, be fearless when challenging an opponent, and never back-down even if their only piece remaing is their knight.</p>
      <p> My team has learned enough from me and each other to rank top 10/30 elementary schools. Two years running.</p>

      <p>Teaching programming cocncepts to childeren in a fun and engaging way requiered a lot of inventive strategies. From "how to" methodologies, to white board illustrations and my classroom game, The Robot Maze. In hopes that they could comprehend the basics of psuedo code and be able to apply it when it was time for them to construct their team robot that was tasked with completing 20 obstacles for 2016-2017 FIRST Robotics Competiton.</p>
      <p>My awesome students took second palce at their first, FIRST robotics qualifer.</p>
